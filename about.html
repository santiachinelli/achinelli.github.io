		<p> Hi there! If you've reached this page it means you're probably trying to find out more about me, so here you go! </p>
		<p> If you want to see what tech stack I like to use, <a href="techstack.html">click here</a>. </p>

	<ul>

		<li> I've been an avid Linux user since I bought my first computer with babysitting money (many moons ago). </li>
		<li> I got my first real deal Linux admin job when I was 20, and I loved it! </li>
		<li> I've spent the better part of my 20s working in Operations and Management, learning on the go and solving business problems in scalable ways alongside government, private, and nonprofit clients.</li>
		<li> During and after the pandemic, I started providing pro-bono IT and software development services to small non-profits making a difference in my community. </li>
		<li> I'm currently looking for a product or support role helping small businesses leverage SaaS and self-hosted infrastructure to differentiate local quality from larger competitors.<il>

	</ul>


	<p1> In short, I'm a generalist with a soft spot for people-first projects. I like fast paced environments and helping solve tangible problems for good causes. </p1>
	<p1> Drop me a line if you know somebody who might like to collaborate on a project, or if you just want to have a coffee chat. </p1>
