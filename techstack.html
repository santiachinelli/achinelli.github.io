<h1>My Tech Stack</h1>

<strong>
<p> This is a non-exhaustive and constantly changing list of tools, ecosystems, and software I like to use. </p> 
</strong>
<p> I value stable, <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a> more than fadtech.

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Git (keeps my notes, configs and this website synced up)</li>
<li>Linux (server, desktop, embedded)</li>
<li>Unix (technically unix-likes, FreeBSD and MacOS)</li>
<li>gitea/gitlab-ce (two self-hosted git repositories I like for different reasons. gitlab-ce is better for onprem, gitea for small teams)</li> 
<li>Docker (and podman) </li>
<li>Virtualization (QEMU and Virtualbox mainly, have had some fun with FreeBSD bhyve and jails in the past)</li>
<li>ZFS and BTRFS</li>
<li>Ansible (automation)</li>
<li>Bash (automation and general scripting fun)</li></li>
<li>Javascript (nodejs and currently using deno a lot)</li>
<li>Server hardening and best practices(learning container security practices since that's the way the industry has shifted)</li>
<li>Vue (and derivatives like Nuxt)</li>
</ul>

<h2>SaaS I like Using</h2> 

<ul>
<li>Twilio (Telephony is a black box most of the time, much easier with Twilio)</li>
<li>Sendgrid (Also by Twilio, but much better/cheaper for newsletters than Constant Contact and other email marketing "tools"</li>
<li>AWS (When self-hosting is not an option)</li>
<li>Netlify(It's fast, although I also like Deno Deploy)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hugo(and I guess, other SSGs) I started with Jekyll way back when, moved to Hugo for simplicity.</li>
<li>A-Frame (for building AR/XR experiences and generally having a good time)</li>
<li>Twine (Great for telling stories, surprisingly good as a presentation tool as well)</li>
<li>Judo (the sport, not a flavor-of-day frontend)</li>
</ul>
